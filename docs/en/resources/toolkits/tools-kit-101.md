Community Recommended Technical Toolkit

> **Preface**: This toolkit is designed for students participating in the DKU-XiaoxBao charity project (including programming beginners), aiming to help you quickly find suitable tools, lower technical barriers, and allow you to focus more energy on "truly helping patients/families".

## 1. RAG Product Technology Stack Tools

### What is RAG?
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technology that enables AI to "consult" specific documents before answering questions. Simply put: you can upload medical documents, patient manuals, treatment guidelines, etc. to the system, allowing the AI to answer user questions based on this content rather than making things up.

**Your Value**: If your project needs to provide disease knowledge Q&A, medication guide queries, medical process consultations and other functions for patients, RAG tools can help you quickly build a "dedicated knowledge base + AI customer service" without writing code from scratch.
