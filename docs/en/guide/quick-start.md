# DKU-XiaoxBao Community Innovation Campus Project: Quick Start & Must-Know Guideline

## Project Background and Goals

- **Initiators**: Jointly initiated by DKU, CMC, XiaoxBao Community and related charitable foundations.
- **Project Direction**: Charitable projects for patients with cancer/rare diseases and their families.
- **Participation Format**: Recruiting approximately 6 student teams on campus to explore innovative solutions combining technology and charity through real problem-driven project practice.
- **Core Goals**:
  - **Help Real Individuals**: Even if the project truly helps just 1 patient/family, it's already worthwhile.
  - **Cultivate Correct Views on Charity**: Advocate for long-term companionship, multi-party collaboration, respect for professionalism and compliance.
  - **Enhance Students' Comprehensive Abilities**: Including empathy, project management, product/technical skills, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

## 3 Baseline Reminders

To ensure the project runs smoothly, we have prepared this guide with the purpose of:

- **Informing**: Explaining the execution principles you need to follow. Please adhere to these principles as they will help with community resource acquisition, volunteer communication, project advancement, establishing correct views on charity, and achieving project goals.
- **Protection and Supervision**: This project may involve communication with cancer or rare disease patients/families, so please pay special attention to communication methods and your own psychological protection. All project processes and communications should be under the guidance and transparent supervision of DKU / CMC / Foundation. **The community does not encourage** separate 1-on-1 private communications; transparency in communication and information synchronization within reasonable limits is encouraged.
- **Compliance**: This project may involve data compliance and privacy protection. You must comply with national laws and community agreements, strictly prohibit any form of data violations, and ensure ethical compliance.

## Management Structure and Role Division

### Project Management Committee (PMC)

- **Composition**: Composed of representatives from DKU / CMC / Foundation.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - **Coordination and Supervision**: Ensure the project aligns with charitable intentions and ethical regulatory requirements.
  - **Resource Coordination**: Provide necessary resources and support to students within reasonable limits.
  - **Risk Control**: Review major matters involving data, compliance, partners, etc.

### Project Management Roles

- **PMC**: Conducts overall coordination and control, resolving unified coordination of resources, personnel, and schedules across projects.
- **Mentor**: Assigned per project, provides guidance and support to corresponding project groups, including:
  - Grasping project direction and scope
  - Key technical or product advice
  - Resource connection and process accompaniment
- **Leader (Project Lead)**:
  - Responsible for overall implementation of the project group, including team organization, schedule design, product definition, product implementation, user testing and feedback, and documentation.
  - Bears ultimate coordination and decision-making responsibility within the project (within compliance framework).
- **Member (Project Member)**:
  - Responsible for implementing specific tasks (research, design, development, testing, operations, etc.).
  - Accountable for self-assigned tasks, timely synchronization of progress and difficulties.

> **Recommendation**: Each project group should clarify a Leader and backup Leader as much as possible, and establish a basic project management rhythm (e.g., weekly standup meetings).

## Communication and Collaboration Mechanisms

- **Recommended Communication Methods**:
  - **Project WeChat Group**: Transparent communication, allowing the Supervisory Committee (DKU / CMC / Foundation representatives) and Mentor to understand your efforts, progress, difficulties, and feedback, making it easier to receive support.
  - **GitHub Repository**: Encouraged to join the dedicated repository, create a directory for your project (or independent repository), seek help in issues, and let the open source world help you.
  - **Online/Offline Meetings**: Important decisions are recommended to be made in multi-person meetings with brief minutes.
- **Situations to Avoid**:
  - Try to avoid deep private communications bypassing the Supervisory Committee, especially regarding sensitive topics such as funding, data, patient privacy, and commercial cooperation.
  - For communications outside official guidance and records, the community cannot manage them, and corresponding risks and responsibilities may be borne by you personally.

> **Tip**: When encountering requests that make you uncomfortable, unsure about compliance, or don't know how to refuse, prioritize seeking help in the group or from your Mentor / DKU teacher rather than handling it alone.

## Project Lifecycle and Key Milestones (Example)

The specific rhythm of different projects will vary, but generally you can refer to the following phased arrangement (using several months as an example, for reference only when planning within your group):

- **Phase One: Understanding and Focusing (approximately 1–2 weeks)**
  - **Output**: One-page project document (project overview, target users, core problem to solve, expected impact).
- **Phase Two: Solution Design and Prototyping (approximately 2–4 weeks)**
  - **Output**: Product/service prototype (could be wireframes, flowcharts, MVP, small tool demo, etc.), along with a brief user journey description.
- **Phase Three: Implementation and Iteration (approximately 4–6 weeks)**
  - **Output**: Runnable version / implementation plan, collect preliminary feedback (such as small-scale user testing, expert feedback, mentor suggestions).
- **Phase Four: Summary and Sharing**
  - **Output**: Project summary report, presentation materials (slides / demo), suggestions for subsequent sustainability.

> **Important Consensus**: This project is not measured by "commercial success," but by "whether individuals are truly respected, whether genuine attempts are made to solve a real problem."

## Precautions for Communicating with Patients/Families

- **You Are Not a Doctor**:
  - Do not provide diagnostic advice or recommend specific drugs or treatment plans.
  - Avoid promises like "guaranteed effective" or "definitely no problem."
- **Respect and Empathy**:
  - Allow the other party to express genuine emotions (anxiety, anger, sadness, etc.), but don't try to "quickly solve everything."
  - Use an equal, respectful tone, avoiding condescension or "deciding for them."
- **Appropriate Sense of Boundaries**:
  - You can listen, provide information and tools, but don't get overly involved in the other party's family private decisions.
  - If you feel excessive pressure, seek help from your Mentor or DKU teacher in a timely manner.
- **Guide to Professional Resources**:
  - For key medical issues, encourage the other party to return to their attending physician or regular medical institution.
  - If the project involves expressing professional information, try to have professionals review and check it.

## Data, Compliance, and Ethics Requirements (Must Read)

- **What Is Sensitive/Private Data?**
  - Personal identification information: name, ID number, contact information, address, workplace, specific hospital and department for treatment, etc.
  - Health and condition information: specific disease diagnosis, treatment plan, examination results, medication information, etc.
  - Other information that can identify a specific individual alone or in combination.
- **You Must**:
  - **Do not actively collect** any personal privacy data unrelated to the project.
  - If collection is necessary (e.g., user testing, questionnaires, etc.), you must:
    - Obtain prior approval from DKU / CMC / Foundation and relevant ethical/approval processes;
    - Clearly inform the other party of the purpose, storage method, and usage boundaries;
    - Conduct desensitization and anonymization as much as possible.
  - Do not store data containing personal privacy in insecure environments (such as personal cloud drives, personal public repositories, etc.).
- **Strictly Prohibited Actions**:
  - Unauthorized collection, storage, or dissemination of any personal privacy data of patients or families.
  - Using personal information encountered in the project for purposes unrelated to the project (such as commercialization attempts, personal research, etc.).
  - Inducing the other party to provide private information, especially under the guise of "help" or "exchange for benefits."
- **Consequences of Violation**:
  - Crossing the red line of privacy and data security may lead to:
    - At the community level: project cancellation, project withdrawal, public notification and condemnation;
    - At the school or partner organization level: disciplinary action;
    - In serious cases: legal liability in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Q: "I'm afraid this project will fail, how should I think about it?"**  
  **A**: Remember, our success is not judged by commercial value. If you haven't given up, seriously completed an application/solution, and even if you only helped one patient or family member, we consider this project valuable. One person's life and a hundred people's lives are equal in dignity and significance.

- **Q: "How to communicate and provide feedback, seek help, and promote problem solving?"**  
  **A**: Recommended process:
  - **Priority to project WeChat group communication**: Transparent communication allows the Supervisory Committee and Mentor to understand your progress, difficulties, and needs, facilitating support.
  - **Effectively use GitHub issues**: Raise clear questions or requirements in the repository, facilitating asynchronous collaboration.
  - **Schedule a deep discussion when necessary**: Arrange a 1:1 or small discussion with your Mentor or PMC members, but important conclusions are recommended to be briefly synchronized in the group.

- **Q: "Who will guide us?"**  
  **A**: The community will assign one Mentor for each project, providing project guidance, development assistance, resource coordination, and help with difficult issues. Depending on the situation, industry experts may also be invited to participate in phased reviews or short-term guidance.

- **Q: "If I want to give up and quit, can I?"**  
  **A**: We understand that everyone has objective circumstances and pressures, but we hope you'll try before "quitting":
  - **Adjust the pace**: Reasonably extend the time, lower phased goals, don't put too much pressure on yourself. This is not a commercial company; we don't have strict commercial deadlines.
  - **Communicate more**: Loneliness is one of the reasons many projects are interrupted. Try to communicate more in the group, with your Mentor, with classmates, and you'll find many "climbers" on the road.
  - **Use tools effectively**: Don't reinvent the wheel; there are already a large number of achievements in GitHub and the open source world for reference and reuse.
  If you ultimately decide to quit, that's also fine. Please contact your DKU teacher or Mentor to complete necessary documentation and handover. We look forward to collaborating again at another time in the future.

- **Q: "What project am I participating in?"**  
  **A**: This initiative will list 5–6 project themes around cancer/rare disease charity directions. During registration and communication, your project preferences will be prioritized; we will make final assignments considering team situations, mentor allocation, and project maturity.

- **Q: "If I'm not satisfied with my project or mentor, what should I do?"**  
  **A**: You can provide feedback to any representative of the Supervisory Committee (DKU teachers are usually a more direct entry point), explaining your feelings and requests. We encourage expressing dissatisfaction in a constructive, specific manner (e.g., pointing out specific scenarios, expected improvements), jointly seeking better arrangements rather than holding it in.

- **Q: "If during the process I'm asked to spend time or money on things unrelated to the project, or I feel the other party's behavior involves data violations or non-charitable commercial purposes, what should I do?"**  
  **A**: Please immediately be vigilant and:
  - **Report to DKU / CMC / Foundation members immediately**, preserve chat records, emails, and other evidence.
  - **We encourage you to firmly refuse improper practices and unreasonable demands**, including but not limited to: paid purchases unrelated to the project, part-time/labor arrangements, excessive requests for private information, demands to waive intellectual property rights, etc.
  The community **strictly prohibits** any improper transactions, commercial guidance, or obtaining private data under the name of charity, both inside and outside the project. Crossing the red line will face maximum community handling, serious accountability at the school or organization level, and may also violate laws in serious cases.

- **Q: "What compliance requirements do I need to pay attention to, what suggestions does the community have?"**  
  **A**: You can remember from the following three perspectives:
  - **Legal Compliance**: Comply with Chinese laws and regulations on personal information protection, data security, and internet content. Better to "ask one more time" than to "take for granted."
  - **Institutional Norms**: Respect the internal norms and mentor suggestions of DKU / CMC / Foundation. Report and communicate in advance regarding data, partners, and external publicity.
  - **Personal Bottom Line**: Be vigilant and actively seek help for any demands that make you feel uncomfortable, unclear, or "not quite right." Better to be slower than to risk crossing the red line.
