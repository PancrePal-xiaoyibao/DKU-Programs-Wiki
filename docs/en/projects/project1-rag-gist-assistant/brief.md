# Project 1: Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) Intelligent Assistant (XiaoJixing)

## Project Background

Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, accounting for 1%-3% of all gastrointestinal malignancies. The annual incidence is approximately (10-20)/million. With advances in pathological detection techniques, the detection rate has been gradually increasing. This disease predominantly affects middle-aged and elderly populations, with a median onset age of approximately 65 years, with no significant gender differences. Approximately 50%-70% of cases occur in the stomach, followed by the small intestine (20%-30%), with the colon, rectum, and esophagus accounting for less than 10%. The biological behavior is diverse, ranging from benign to malignant, with approximately 30% being malignant tumors. The primary metastatic sites are the liver and peritoneal cavity.

Patients and their families often face difficulties in obtaining information, barriers in understanding professional medical knowledge, and confusion in choosing treatment plans during the diagnosis and treatment process. This project aims to provide GIST patients with professional, timely, and understandable medical information support through AI technology.

## Cancer Type Definitions

**Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST) Main Characteristics:**

- **Definition**: The most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, originating from intestinal interstitial cells (Cajal cells)
- **Primary Locations**:
  - **Stomach**: 50%-70% (most common)
  - **Small Intestine**: 20%-30% (second most common)
  - **Colon, Rectum, and Esophagus**: <10%
- **Biological Behavior**: Ranges from benign to malignant, approximately 30% are malignant tumors
- **Metastatic Sites**: Primarily liver and peritoneal cavity
- **High-Risk Population**: Middle-aged and elderly populations, median onset age approximately 65 years

- **Custom Solution**: If the team has technical foundation, can build based on frameworks like LangChain

### Knowledge Base Management
- **Community Recommendation**: FastGPT / Wekora / Ragflow
- **Key Considerations**:
  - How to structure the knowledge base? (By tumor location, by diagnostic stage, by content type)
  - How to pre-process medical documents to improve retrieval accuracy?
  - Need custom chunking strategy?

### Bot Integration
- **WeChat**: Can use frameworks like WeChaty, OpenAI, etc.
- **Telegram**: python-telegram-bot
- **Web Page**: Can embed FastGPT's dialogue component or build custom interface

### Optional Plugins and Optimization
- **Embedding Optimization**: Embedding model for medical domain or preprocessing plugin
- **Multi-location Routing**: Intelligently identify user intent and route to corresponding knowledge base
- **Content Security**: Sensitive word filtering, medical compliance checking



## Knowledge Base Resource References

### Existing Resources (refer to XiaoxBao Community Projects)

The XiaoxBao community already has multiple oncology AI assistant projects (such as XiaoPiBao, XiaoFuBao). You can:
- Understand knowledge base structure design ideas
- Refer to medical document chunking and preprocessing methods
- Learn how to organize knowledge bases for multiple cancer types
