# Project 5: Gynecological Cancer Intelligent Assistant (Xiaofubao)

## Project Background

Gynecological cancers (including cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, etc.) are major diseases threatening women's health. Patients and their families often face difficulties in obtaining information, barriers in understanding professional knowledge, and confusion in choosing treatment plans during the diagnosis and treatment process. This project aims to provide patients with gynecological cancers with professional, timely, and understandable medical information support through AI technology.

## Cancer Type Definitions

**Gynecological Cancers primarily include:**

- **Cervical Cancer**
- **Endometrial Cancer / Uterine Cancer**
- **Ovarian Cancer**
- **Vulvar Cancer**
- **Vaginal Cancer**

> **Note**: This project recommends prioritizing the three most common gynecological cancers.



## Project Goals

- **Lower Information Barriers**: Explain professional medical knowledge in accessible language
- **Provide Decision Reference**: Offer diagnostic information support based on authoritative guidelines
- **Emotional Support and Companionship**: Provide 24/7 information companionship through AI assistant
- **Patient Empowerment**: Help patients better understand their condition and participate in treatment decisions

## Core Value Propositions

- **Authority**: Based on authoritative medical guidelines such as CSCO (Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology)
- **Professionalism**: Covers professional content including diagnostic recommendations, drug information, genetic testing interpretation
- **Usability**: Supports natural language dialogue, multi-platform access (WeChat, Telegram, etc.)
- **Safety**: Clear disclaimer, emphasizing auxiliary nature, does not replace professional medical consultation



## Target Users

### Primary Users
- Gynecological cancer patients and their families
- Women concerned about gynecological health
- Patients at different diagnostic stages (pre-diagnosis, during treatment, rehabilitation period)

### Secondary Users
- Medical staff and medical students (as auxiliary tool)
- Health education workers
- Community volunteers (Blue Vests)



## Product Form

**Core Architecture**: RAG AI Service + Multi-platform Bots

### Recommended Implementation Method
- **Dialogue Entry Points**: WeChat Bot / Telegram Bot / Web Page
- **Backend Service**: RAG Intelligent Q&A System
- **Knowledge Base**: Structured medical knowledge base (guidelines, drugs, genetic testing, patient experience)

### Product Innovation Space (for student team exploration)

Here are some possible innovation directions, **the team is encouraged to propose their own unique ideas**:

- **Multimodal Interaction**: Support image recognition (e.g., OCR of examination reports)?
- **Personalized Recommendations**: How to provide customized information based on user's specific situation (cancer type, stage, treatment phase)?
- **Emotional Support Function**: Besides information queries, provide psychological counseling, rehabilitation advice, etc.?
- **Community Interaction**: Connect to patient groups, promote experience sharing?
- **Multi-cancer Type Routing**: How to intelligently identify the cancer type from user queries and route to corresponding knowledge base?
- **Data Security and Privacy**: How to provide personalized services without collecting privacy?

> **Important Reminder**: Please discuss your innovative ideas with Mentor in the early stages of the project to ensure the direction is feasible and aligns with charitable intentions.



## Technology Stack Recommendations

### RAG System
- **Community Recommendation**: Fastgpt (Chinese-friendly, ready to use)
- **Open Source Solutions**: Dify, Ragflow (more flexible, requires some development skills)
- **Custom Solution**: If the team has technical foundation, can build based on frameworks like LangChain

### Knowledge Base Management
- **Community Recommendation**: Fastgpt / Wekora / Ragflow
- **Key Considerations**:
  - How to structure the knowledge base? (By cancer type, by diagnostic stage, by content type)
  - How to pre-process medical documents to improve retrieval accuracy?
  - Need custom chunking strategy?

### Bot Integration
- **WeChat**: Can use frameworks like WeChaty, OpenAI, etc.
- **Telegram**: python-telegram-bot
- **Web Page**: Can embed FastGPT's dialogue component or build custom interface

### Optional Plugins and Optimization
- **Embedding Optimization**: Embedding model for medical domain or preprocessing plugin
- **Multi-cancer Type Routing**: Intelligently identify user intent and route to corresponding knowledge base
- **Content Security**: Sensitive word filtering, medical compliance checking



## Knowledge Base Resource References

### Existing Resources (refer to xiaofubao repository)

The reference repository has completed RAG preprocessing of part of the basic knowledge base, you can:
- Understand knowledge base structure design ideas
- Refer to medical document chunking and preprocessing methods
- Learn how to organize knowledge bases for multiple cancer types

**Knowledge Base Structure Example**:
```
Knowlege_base/
├── 01_guidance/          # CSCO Clinical Guidelines
│   ├── 01_cervical_cancer/
│   ├── 02_endometrial_cancer/
│   └── 03_ovarian_cancer/
├── 02_drugs/             # Drug Information Base
├── 03_genie/             # Genetic Testing Information
└── 04_patients_expertise/ # Patient Experience Sharing
```

### What You Need to Do
- **Don't copy directly**: After understanding the structure, design your own knowledge base according to your product positioning
- **Supplement new content**: According to project needs, supplement more medical resources, patient cases, etc.
- **Optimize and innovate**: How to make the knowledge base better support your innovative features?



## Project Implementation Recommendations

- Design product interaction flow and dialogue logic
- Output: Product requirement document, interactive design prototype

### Phase Two: Knowledge Base Construction and RAG Setup (2-4 weeks)
- Collect and organize medical knowledge resources
- Perform document preprocessing and knowledge base import
- Build RAG Q&A system and test accuracy
